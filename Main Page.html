    <h2>What is the Owl House?</h2>
    <p>The Owl House is a 2020 American animated show made by Dana Terrace that aired on Disney Channel until April 8th, 2023.</p>
    <p>The Owl House is about Luz the Human and her adventures as she learns magic and explores the world of the Boiling Isles alongside her mentor Eda the Owl Lady and the King of Demons and many more friends she meets along the way</p>

    <h2>Why I Care</h2>
    <p>The Owl House is a good show overall but what I think draws me and so many others to it is how it deals with themes of trauma and abuse in a more frank and open way than any other animated show I've watched before.</p>
    <p>It also is a huge step forward for all sorts of representation of all sorts, including its multiracial cast and its queer lead alongside many other important supporting characters and even some disability and neurodivergent representation</p>
    <p>Overall what this show does is make me feel seen as well as just watching these unique and fun characters go through hardship and lose so much but still see them perservere through it all</p>

    <h2>Why You Should Care</h2>
    <p>If nothing else The Owl House is a fun show and I think its one of the best pieces of fiction I personally have ever consumed and I think everyone should watch it at least once</p>
    <p>With its thoughtfully crafted world and characters, amazing story, and many, many tear-jerking moments I think The Owl House is so much more than a tragically cut-short show, but rather should and likely will be an inspiration for artists of all kinds in a way that hasn't been seen before and likely won't for a long time after</p>
